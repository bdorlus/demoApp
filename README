# DemoApp – AI Ping Service (Starter)

A tiny FastAPI service to demo AI-powered endpoints later.  
Right now it does one thing, and does it well:

> ✅ `GET /status` → returns `{"status": "ok", "app": "DemoApp"}`

This keeps the surface area small for a workshop, but gives you a clean path to bolt on AI tools (CodeX, etc.) later.

├── Makefile
